-- AFKService: tracks whether players have set themselves as AFK.
--
-- Clients can toggle their AFK state via the `SetAFK` RemoteEvent.  When a
-- player is marked AFK they will not be teleported to the start of the
-- course, nor will their votes count in course selection.  This service
-- exposes a simple `IsAFK` method for other server scripts to query.

-- Toggle or set AFK for a player.  If `state` is nil the state will
-- toggle; otherwise it will be set explicitly to the boolean value.  This
-- event is fired from the client when the player presses the AFK key.
